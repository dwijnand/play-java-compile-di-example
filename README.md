# play-java-compile-di-example

This is a Play project using the Java API and compile time dependency injection.

It is intentionally very simple and basic to show how compile time DI works in Play with the Java API.

There is also an [example](https://github.com/playframework/play-java-dagger2-example) using Java compile time DI with [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/).

## Running

Start up the server with sbt:

```
sbt run
```

Then go to the server at http://localhost:9000 to see "Hello".
